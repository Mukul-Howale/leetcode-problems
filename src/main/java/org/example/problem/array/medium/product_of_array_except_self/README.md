## Problem Description
Given an integer array `nums`, return an array `answer` such that `answer[i]` is equal to the product of all the elements of `nums` except `nums[i]`.

### Constraints
- The product of any prefix or suffix of `nums` is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit integer.
- You must write an algorithm that runs in **O(n)** time.
- **Division operations are not allowed**.
